How to push code to git and git hub:

Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository
This command creates a .git folder in your project directory, which will be used by Git to track changes in your project. 

git init

Step 2: Add Files to the Staging Area
To stage all the files in your project (i.e., to tell Git which files to track and commit), use the following command:

git add .

The . means "all files in the current directory" — this will add all modified, newly created, or deleted files.

Step 3: Commit Your Changes
After staging the files, you need to commit them. A commit in Git represents a snapshot of your files at that point in time.

To commit your staged files, use the following command:

git commit -m "Your commit message"

In your Git Bash (still in your project directory), run the following command to link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

git checkout -b UAT

git push -u origin UAT

git pull origin UAT
